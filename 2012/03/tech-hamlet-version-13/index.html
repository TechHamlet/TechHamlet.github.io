<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/techhamlet-13-550x412.jpg" alt="Tech Hamlet 13.0" /></p>

<p>Our previous version <a href="http://techhamlet.com/2011/10/tech-hamlet-12/">Tech Hamlet 12.0</a> is a completely unique design. But, we made it in a big hurry! We wanted to switch to a new host before the previous one expired. So, it&rsquo;s a big hurry and we had to waste a lot of money to hire people and configure the server. We went into a lot of trouble making that change. Just like that, it also gave us a lot of troubles in the past few months. There were some design flaws. We thought of fixing them later but it never happened. The theme framework we used (Thesis) didn&rsquo;t got enough updates and it started to conflict with the plugins. The software running in the server also got very old and some conflicts start to rise in it. So, we decided to go for the biggest update we made in our history!</p>

<p>This time, we took as much time as we can and tried to make things perfect as possible. We tested things in our local machines and then installed on the new server and again tested them. Fixed bugs, tuned the server, made minor adjustments and now we are confident about our new site! Lets see what we did one by one&hellip;</p>

<h3>A new theme framework and a new design :</h3>

<p>Earlier, we used Thesis. A popular theme framework with a lot of SEO support. But, it had several problems. The biggest issue is that it refused to folow the Wordpress standards. Because of this, some plugins started to give errors. Some never even worked. It also had conflicts with my caching plugins and tried to mess up the databases several times. The other issue is that Thesis is not updated frequently. Its getting old. They say that they are going to release Thesis 2.0. But where is it? It&rsquo;s too late&hellip;</p>

<p>We switched to <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/themes/genesis">Genesis</a>. A well updated theme framework developed by StudioPress. It stays with Wordpress standards and its even easier to customize and update the theme. We won&rsquo;t lose the design if we update the core framework! That&rsquo;s really cool!</p>

<p>We changed our framework and then started to build our own theme. On January, we introduced our second site <a href="http://techhamlet.com/2012/01/cyber-gnome/">Cyber Gnome</a>. Many people liked its design because it was very simple. So, I thought of putting some of those features into TH. So, you can see that TH and CG have slight similarities. But TH is different. Cyber Gnome have several unique features tailored to its theme. For example, it&rsquo;s a news site&hellip; We need to add a lot of new topics to it. So, the reader must see how fresh the article is. That&rsquo;s why we have made the published time more visible. It will tell you how many minutes have passed since we published the post. But TH doesn&rsquo;t need such things.</p>

<p>Earlier when I made the designs, I didn&rsquo;t think much about development rules and didn&rsquo;t even write clean code. But its different in TH 13. The code is clean and well commented.</p>

<p>Since we do a lot of giveaways, we have added a giveaway box to the top of the sidebar. In TH 12 also we did this. But we had to put it manually. In TH 13, it will be added automatically and it will also get removed when we end the giveaway.</p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/giveaway-widget.jpg" alt="The Giveaway Widget" /></p>

<p>We also have widgets to show latest news from Cyber Gnome, to show the top stories in the home page and to show latest stories in the posts page (Those two stories widgets were ideas of Shanaka Jayatilake).</p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/latest-news.jpg" alt="Latest News" /></p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/top-latest-stories-548x550.jpg" alt="Top and Latest Stories" /></p>

<p>This time, we moved the social counts to the very top and did some adjustments to the code so that it will load more faster. Now it doesn&rsquo;t need to get the RSS Feed count every time a user load the page&hellip; We have used the Wordpress cron to get the RSS count and  cache it twice a day.</p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/social-count.jpg" alt="Social Counts" /></p>

<p>Now The home page is clean&hellip; We changed the format of our posts. Earlier, we had different sizes of images and paragraphs in the home page. Now its well-organized. Earlier we adjusted the home page content with a read more tag. But now its auto generated. All the images are of the same dimension&hellip; Its neat! In the post page also you&rsquo;ll notice that things are neatly organized.</p>

<h3>Less ads :</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but I really hate ads. One of the biggest reasons we dropped TH 12 is its full of ads. When you come to a post, there&rsquo;s an ad at the top, to the left of the post and at the very end of the post. The header ad also didn&rsquo;t go with the theme. But this time, we have a big ad in the top, top of the sidebar, in the author bio and a small set of text links at the end of the post. No ads will obstruct the post. We are planing to get rid of those 125 banners as soon as we make sure our new advertising plan is working. A new ad plan? Its a big story! I&rsquo;ll tell you about it tomorrow&hellip; (It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://techhamlet.com/sponsor-us/">science fiction story</a>!)</p>

<h3>New server software but the same host :</h3>

<p>If you stayed with us for the last year, you should already know that we had some difficulties in finding a good VPS host for our site. I think we tried more than 5 hosts. Some we tested for months but they didn&rsquo;t work for us. We were afraid to go for self managed hosts. But, finally we went for Media Temple and hired some experts to configure it. We did this change while releasing our previous version 12.0. But I think <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/#a_aid=4e96319dcc51f&amp;a_bid=5ec4d3a6">Media Temple</a> is the right host for us. Their servers are really great. A lot of CPU power&hellip; But, I can&rsquo;t say much about their support because I don&rsquo;t use it much. The server is self managed so I take care of things by myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/#a_aid=4e96319dcc51f&amp;a_bid=5ec4d3a6"><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mt-250x140-dk.png" alt="Media Temple" /></a></p>

<p>But soon we recognized that the OS and the software we installed on it were really old. It also had several conflicts. So, we decided to re install everything. We took our site to a shared server temporarily and made the changes. I did some of the stuff by myself and hired a freelancer to check things up. I must say the new server is performing really well and now even my cache plugins are working better than before. Earlier the css and js minification never worked. But now, it works perfectly! No idea whether it&rsquo;s the server or the theme Framework&hellip;</p>

<h3>Back to the old commenting system Disqus. But we did some cool changes&hellip;</h3>

<p>Recently, we tested <a href="http://www.livefyre.com/">Livefyre</a> on our site. Its a real-time comment system which really worked. That system is really great but it&rsquo;s still new and had several stability issues. It didn&rsquo;t write the comment back to my database for several weeks. So, I contacted them and tried to fix things. It looks like things are going to get delayed. But I should say that their support is really great and they&rsquo;ll try to help you in any way they can. Will consider about it in the future! (Our site Cyber Gnome still use Livefyre).</p>

<p>Finally, we switched back to our old favourite <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>! Its more stable and easy to moderate. Normally, Disqus allows you to customize things with custom CSS&hellip; But I never used it&hellip; This time, we changed it to fit the theme of our site. Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/comments-550x475.jpg" alt="Comments" /></p>

<h3>We cleaned up a lot of junk in our databases and made a lot of core improvements&hellip;</h3>

<p>With time, your WordPress databases can grow big. Some old and removed plugins might have left some junk behind. When moving to our new server, I scanned and removed a lot of junk like this. Not only the post meta tables, but also the post table got a lot of junk. If you want to prune it, check for posts with post type set to something other than the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types">standard types</a>. I cut down the size of my post database by half. The thing is, I used Intense debate earlier. It have written a lot of entries to my posts tables. A lot! Lucky for me, Livefyre gave me issues. That&rsquo;s why I took a look at the databases&hellip; Now they were removed and the site is still working!</p>

<p>This time we re-installed Wordpress and also added a new set of plugins. Even replaced some of the plugins with our own code snippets.  As I said earlier, we built the system in a local test machine and after making sure its stable enough to work on the live site, we installed it. Then, took more than a week, fixing bugs, adjusting the theme, tuning the server to handle traffic and use the resources more efficiently, and tuning the whole site. We never did this before. After we put up the design, we normally forget about the problems which come next. This time, we went searching for them and took them down.</p>

<p>We also made a lot of core improvements. Some are from the server-side. For example, normally, the Wordpress cron will be executed every time a user visit the site. This will add too much load to the server. It also made our backup plugins go crazy. So, we prevented it from running automatically and set the server&rsquo;s cron to execute it every 5 minutes. Now things are perfect.</p>

<p>We learnt a lot while putting up this new version. We will surely share them with you in our upcoming posts. So, open your eyes and <a href="http://techhamlet.com/subscribe-form/">stay tuned</a>!</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Don&rsquo;t you think this new version is better than the others? Don&rsquo;t you think that we can take our site to the next level with this update? Leave your comments and suggestions in the comment section below. Also if you have any critics, post them also! We need to know your true feelings about our new site!</p>
