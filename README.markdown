#Tech Hamlet

This is the source code for [TechHamlet.com](http://techhamlet.com). It is built on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). I have done a lot of customization to the design and the basic layout. Here are some features that I have managed to add (there are more) :

####Features added :

* Featured images for posts. Every post will have a `fimage` tag. The site will pull the image path from this tag and use it to display a post image in the index and in the sidebar recent posts.
* Featured posts. If the `featured` tag is set to true in a post, the blog index will style that post differently. (For example, add a bigger image to it)
* Auto excerpts. Octopress have excerpts. The only thing is you have to add the `<!--more-->` tag manually. I imported nearly 1,500 posts from my old wordpress setup. I can't go through all these posts and add the more tag manually! So, I used the `truncatewords` method in Liquid Templates like this :

{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 30 }}

* One of the best things about Octopress is that you can get free hosting on Github. But there's a problem... If you upload the source to Github (Free account), anyone can get your posts easily (Thats what I think. Im not sure). You can push the source to a different place like Bitbucket. But it won't make the source open. So, I pushed the posts, pages and their images to my private repository in Bitbucket and left the source in Github. This bring another problem. You need to push the source, pages, posts and images separately to their own origins which can become a big headache. But, I created two scripts to **commit** and **push**. To take care of all the repositories from one script. I will write about it in [Tech Hamlet](http://techhamlet.com/) in the near future. (They are not included in the source).
* And there are some more tiny things I added...

####Major problems :

* The current major problem I'm facing is the long archive pages! Octopress doesn't paginate category and archive pages. In my blog archive, I have nearly 1,500 posts! If any one know how to fix it, [please let me know](http://techhamlet.com/contact/)
