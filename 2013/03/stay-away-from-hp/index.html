<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hp-550x385.jpg" alt="HP" /> <em>Image Source : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gotshoo/2249272967/">Chris Scheufele</a></em></p>

<p>Many people go for HP because their products are available everywhere. Some people think it&rsquo;s the best. Some stores only have HP products. But does this mean they are the best? Here&rsquo;s my own experience on HP&hellip;</p>

<h3>My First HP Machine Went Dead On The First Use&hellip;</h3>

<p>I bought my first HP laptop on 2011. It&rsquo;s a Pavilion DV6. The machine was a Core i7 notebook with a good ATI Radeon graphics card. I thought its a really good machine. Brought it home and tried to create the recovery disks and the machine went dead. It didn&rsquo;t switch on. I took it to the retailer and they gave me a new machine. Its a close call.</p>

<h3>HP Service Center Said They Couldn&rsquo;t Help Because I Have Install Third Party Software&hellip;</h3>

<p>I used the machine for several days and noticed its over heating. The retailer sent me to the HP service center and those guys said its fine. The machine worked without much issues. But the graphic driver kept crashing. I took it to HP and they said they can&rsquo;t help because I have installed some third-party software apart from the ones that came pre-installed on the machine! They told me to use Internet Explorer and all the other pre-installed crap! Who they think we are? Every one will install their own software on their machines. Later I found out that the problem was with the VGA drivers. If I clean installed them they could be fixed.</p>

<h3>HP Said The Tools I Used Give Wrong Reading But Finally Replaced my Failing Hard Drive&hellip;</h3>

<p>Again I got an issue&hellip; This time, its with the hard disk. There were bad sectors in it!  When I took it to HP, they said they can&rsquo;t accept it because they are not sure about the tools I used to get the SMART data! They tried to ignore but I left it with them at last. After several days, they replaced the hard drive and gave it back to me. <strong>After I got the machine, I noticed a lot of scratch marks on the surface!</strong></p>

<h3>Bought A New Laptop&hellip; Replaced it With a New Machine Twice&hellip; Still There Were Problems&hellip;</h3>

<p>Then, I thought of selling it and buying a new one because Linux ATI drivers started to break. I sold it last December and bought another HP Envy machine. It had a Core i7 3rd Gen processor and an Nvidia GPU. The retailer was one of the most trusted in the country. They gave me a sealed box containing the notebook. The first machine had the plastic cover popping out near the touch pad. So they gave me another machine. On the first day, I got a big issue. I started to hear a loud popping sound from the speakers and the head phone jack stopped working. Took the machine to the retailer. They replaced it because it even had a dent near the right speaker. The third machine also got that audio issue. But the retailer failed to pinpoint it. I also tried to partition the drive and that broke the recovery system (I know how to partition without losing the recovery partition). They say it&rsquo;s because of Windows 8.</p>

<h3>Battery Capacity (Not the Charge) is Going Down and The Recovery Failed&hellip;</h3>

<p>Then I used the machine for nearly 3 weeks. Also installed Linux on it. Later I found out that the battery is draining too fast! When I checked, the battery capacity (Not the charge) it is 96%! in a brand new laptop how can this drop so fast? I tried to recover the machine and the recovery failed! They said its because of Linux. But I think there was a failing driver. That&rsquo;s the error it gave me. When I took it to the retailer, they sent it to HP. HP said the system firmware has been corrupted. They have installed the firmware by cloning from another machine but they didn&rsquo;t knew how to activate Windows 8! According to HP, Microsoft haven&rsquo;t told them how to do this! Don&rsquo;t blame me, that&rsquo;s what HP told me&hellip;</p>

<h3>The Online Support Became Very Rude&hellip;</h3>

<p>I contacted the online support to get a solution for this. But they said they can&rsquo;t help me because im not from US! Why? Can&rsquo;t they understand my English? They can&rsquo;t help in replacing the hardware. But they can at least help me to pinpoint the issue.</p>

<h3>Got The Machine Back With Scratches and The Old Problems Unresolved&hellip;</h3>

<p>Then I asked the HP service center to see whether I can Install Linux on it. I asked whether I can do this before buying so they have to check it. Note that I gave these instructions to my retailer. HP people might kill me if I told them to try Linux. But I trust my retailer and those people are really good. They asked what version of Linux I wanted and said they will try it and let me know how to do it. I also told them to recover the machine to the original state after trying Linux. So we can check what really corrupted the firmware.</p>

<p>I got the machine after about a month. There were a lot of scratch marks on the machine just like before. The screen was full of fingerprints.</p>

<p>When handing over the machine, they told me to create a new set of recovery disks. When I tried to do that, the machine didn&rsquo;t let me. It said some one have already created one set of recovery media and I can&rsquo;t do it again! Then why did HP told me to do it? First, I gave the recovery disks I had to them. Later I found out that one recovery disk is missing! That&rsquo;s why they told me to make another set but they forgot that their machines allow us to create only one set of recovery media!</p>

<p>They also told me I don&rsquo;t have to do anything to install Linux. I can do it without any issues. But I know we have to disable secure boot first. When I checked the BIOS, secure boot was disabled and&hellip; there&rsquo;s Linux in it? I told them to recover the machine and see. But Linux is still there! I asked them to try Ubuntu. It&rsquo;s important to try the exact version I asked because different Linux systems handle UEFI issues in different ways. But I found Red Hat Linux! They haven&rsquo;t even completed the installation and it&rsquo;s not even booting normally. I found it out when going through the BIOS. They said everything is working!</p>

<p>Then I check the battery capacity again&hellip; Earlier it was 96%&hellip; Now its 93%! The audio issue is still there&hellip; That&rsquo;s one of the days which I became so furious that I lost control of my self. I called the retailer and blamed them! Sometimes I even screamed at them! I wasted my time traveling back and forth&hellip; When I mostly needed the lap, it wasn&#8217;t there&hellip; I used it only for 3 weeks&hellip; They kept it for more than a month and haven&rsquo;t done anything! Why HP is doing this to us?</p>

<h3>The Retailer Blamed HP for Not Giving Enough Support&hellip;</h3>

<p>Now I actually feel sorry for my retailer. The retailer is a really good place. Those people are really good. But they does one big mistake&hellip; They sell bad products! Finally when I asked for a refund, they told me they&rsquo;ll give it and blamed HP for not giving enough support to solve the issue. I tried two machines from the same model (The first one they replaced even before I can use it) and both of them got issues! I think they are still selling it.</p>

<h3>HP Send Crap to Asian Countries&hellip;</h3>

<p>After this issue, I searched for another notebook to buy. I did a lot of research. I found out a very interesting fact&hellip; Most of the models HP send us doesn&rsquo;t even appear in Google. In both the machines I used, If I try to download the latest drivers from HP, their driver download page won&rsquo;t recognize the product. But there&rsquo;s a way to get to the final download page. It&rsquo;s there but its hidden. Why is this?</p>

<p>For all the western countries, HP sell one product. Then strip off all the good stuff from them and sell them to Asia. Is it because we are black? I need to ask&hellip; HP also use Asian (Chinese) labor to produce some of their products. They use us and then give us crap! Cool isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>I searched for some of the Asus, Lenovo and Acer models available in our local market. Google knew them very well. I can find good and bad ratings for the exact same models&hellip; But unfortunately, the good brands are not that popular in here&hellip;</p>

<h3>HP Doesn&rsquo;t Produce Good Products, But They Know How To Market Their Crap&hellip;</h3>

<p>HP have conquered the market&hellip; Everywhere we look, we see HP. It&rsquo;s not because their products are good.. It&rsquo;s because their marketing is good&hellip; Just like Kaspersky! Most of you don&rsquo;t know this. One of my friends has a computer store and he told me how Kaspersky became the number one anti-virus in our country. According to the ratings, its in the second place. But the number one Bitdefender is nowhere to be seen in our market. Why is this? Kaspersky occasionally invite all the retailers to a five start hotel and give them a luxurious party that they&rsquo;ll never forget! How is that? Then, when ever we go to a retailer, they say &ldquo;Kaspersky&rdquo;!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about marketing! Marketing can sell even the worst product like hot cakes&hellip; My friends&hellip; Be careful when going for HP products&hellip; Not only HP, there are many more people like this&hellip; They have good names but they sell crap. I mentioned about Kaspersky but they are not like HP. They made a great product&hellip; Became the second in the world and now use marketing. HP make crappy products and use marketing to become the number one! You can tell anything but I now know the real state of HP because I have used it. This is my own experiance. Not a review base on third-party facts! So, be careful!</p>

<p>Later, after doing a lot of research, I bought a Core i7 ASUS K55VD machine. The laptop is really solid and really fast. I asked their online support on how to install Linux. Unlike HP, they didn&rsquo;t try to kill me&hellip; They told me to change two settings in the BIOS in order to install another OS. They are humans&hellip; They understand us&hellip; But HP doesn&rsquo;t! Hp think we have to stick with the software they give us. They want us to do what they want&hellip; Not what we want! If you read this article, please try your best to get this to HP! I want them to see this!</p>
