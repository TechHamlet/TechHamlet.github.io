<div class="entry-content"><p>After a very long time of inactivity, we are coming back again! Everyone&#8230; Say hello to Tech Hamlet 15.0! This not just a simple redesign&#8230; The platform have changed&#8230;  The server have changed&#8230;  The policies have changed&#8230;  The way we work have changed&#8230; The layout have changed
&#8230; What we write have changed&#8230;  The design have changed&#8230;  The core code have changed&#8230;  Everything have changed in Tech Hamlet!</p>

<p><img src="/images/post-images/2013/08/techhamlet-15.jpg" alt="Tech Hamlet 15" /></p>

<h2>Problems with the old site :</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>WordPress</strong> : Yep&#8230;  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> became a problem to us! Its one of the most popular and the most powerful blogging platforms on earth.  But its getting too heavy.  There are a lot of unwanted features.  We can&#8217;t  blame WordPress.  Now that platform is used for a lot of applications.  It&#8217;s not just a blogging platform.  Now it&#8217;s used for blogging, marketing sites, portfolios, and as a CMS for many different kinds of sites. It&#8217;s a mess. Unless you do a full optimization of the server,  the theme and the WordPress core itself,  you might have to spend a huge amount of money to find a good host for it. That&#8217;s the same thing that happened to me. A Web site need to load really fast.  But WordPress have a lot of code to be generated before showing the site to the user. It&#8217;s a big problem!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ads</strong> : The first major problem we had is with Advertisements and Paid links! That&#8217;s what drive most of the blogging community. People sell links and place ads on their websites without focusing on the contents. I hated this. But I also had to sell links and ads to keep the blog running.  I spent a lot of money for the host because I wanted to make things a lot faster. But recently I did a small survey and found out that a lot of people hate ads.  They draw the attention of the users.  That&#8217;s what we want.  But that&#8217;s not what our readers want.  They come here for valuable content.  Not for ads. Selling links is the other problem. Too many links = bad SEO. We even received a penalty from good old Google!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guest posts</strong> : You will be amazed to see how many guest posts we receive. It always give me head aches when trying to go through all these emails. Sometimes, Tech Hamlet publish many irrelevant guest posts than relevant articles from us. Most of the guest posts we receive are off topic and doesn&#8217;t even make sense! With them, we get links. A lot of linking from the guest posts. This is also a major reason that made Google award us a cool penalty!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clutter</strong> : The old Tech Hamlet had too much clutter. A lot of sidebar widgets, a lot of bits and pieces in a post page. All of them steal away the reader&#8217;s attention. That&#8217;s not good. It started as a simple design but later turned into a cluttered porcupine!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The design and the layout</strong> : I made that old design and it looked really good to me. But there were some problems. Too much white in the design made it hard for some people to read. The font is not good. Actually every-time I tried to put a completely new design, WordPress stopped me. Its hard to change the WordPress layout. We can do it but it will be reverted back to defaults when we update. That&#8217;s not good. The other problem with the design is that its old. Many blogs have already upgraded to modern designs!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Categories</strong> : Most of the categories were added back in 2009. I wanted to add as much categories as I can but later it turned out to be a disaster. If we use a wider category model, then it only keep growing. We had to add more categories and it became a bit out of control! Categories should simply tell the reader what we have. But our categories told them that we are making a fruit salad!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WordPress plugins and speed</strong> : In order to get the right functionality, I had to add a lot of plugins. Several times I tried to prune the plugins but that list never shrieked. Those plugins and the dynamic nature of WordPress made the blog slow. That will make the readers sad too!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hosting</strong> : If I need to pay for WordPress hosting, then I need a lot of ads and get my hands dirty. The site need a very powerful server so I had to spend a lot for a good VPS.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Our solutions :</h2>

<h3>No more WordPress ! Hello Octopress !</h3>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/octopress-550x385.jpg" alt="Octopress" /></p>

<p>WordPress is dead. We have just moved away from that platform to Octopress. Its all about static blogging. The <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> framework is built on Jekyll and Ruby. The source code for the website resides in your machine and in a remote git repository (if you need backups). There&#8217;s a default minimal and responsive design added by Octopress. But you are free to change it. I have done a lot of customization to the default Octopress layout. You can&#8217;t say its a Octopress site by just looking at it! I have added the following features to make it more powerful :</p>

<ul>
<li>Featured images for posts. Every post will have a <code>fimage</code> tag. The site will pull the image path from this tag and use it to display a post image in the index and in the sidebar recent posts.</li>
<li>Featured posts. If the <code>featured</code> tag is set to true in a post, the blog index will style that post differently. (For example, add a bigger image to it)</li>
<li>Auto excerpts. Octopress have excerpts. The only thing is you have to add the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag manually. I imported nearly 1,500 posts from my old WordPress setup. I can&#8217;t go through all these posts and add the more tag manually! So, I used the <code>truncatewords</code> method in Liquid Templates like this :</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>post.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 30</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>One of the best things about Octopress is that you can get free hosting on Github. But there&#8217;s a problem&#8230; If you upload the source to Github (Free account), anyone can get your posts easily (Thats what I think. Im not sure). You can push the source to a different place like Bitbucket. But it won&#8217;t make the source open. So, I pushed the posts, pages and their images to my private repository in Bitbucket and left the source in Github. This bring another problem. You need to push the source, pages, posts and images separately to their own origins which can become a big headache. But, I created two scripts to <strong>commit</strong> and <strong>push</strong>. To take care of all the repositories from one script. I will write about it in <a href="http://techhamlet.com/">Tech Hamlet</a> in the near future. (They are not included in the source).</li>
<li>Auto generated open graph meta tags for each and every page</li>
<li>And there are some more tiny things I added&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to use these features on your own site, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/TechHamlet/TechHamlet.github.io">source code of Tech Hamlet</a>. Now its open sourced!</p>

<p>After you setup the layouts, you are ready to go. Then you write the posts. After that, with two commands, Octopress will generate a static HTML version of your site and automatically push it to the server. You are done! In the future, I will write some posts about Octopress so you also can follow. Because its static HTML, Tech Hamlet is now a lot faster than before. The web server doesn&#8217;t have to generate any heavy php before sending it to you. Its already built.</p>

<h3>Almost NO ADS!</h3>

<p>Tech Hamlet 15.0 doesn&#8217;t have any adsense ads&#8230; No links will be sold from both the blogroll and from posts. We will only have two 125x125 ads in the sidebar. Only two small ads for the whole site. It will be enough to keep the ship afloat. It will also please our readers. No ads mean less clutter. Now things are more organized and clean. When designing the previous versions of Tech Hamlet, first it looked like a very nice design. But after I inserted the ads to the template I got sad :( . They made everything look ugly. There&#8217;s no way I can tell what ad Google will place on my site. So it posed a major problem. Now we don&#8217;t have them! Cool isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h3>No more irrelevant guest posts</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://techhamlet.com/contact/">guest posts rules</a> are tightened. If you are here just to get a link to your product or to get a link for your client, no matter how much money you are willing to pay, we won&#8217;t accept your gust post. If you are willing to write a quality article that is related to our site, we will let you write. We will also let you link to your own blog. Not to a product. People who link to products mostly write rubbish!</p>

<h3>No more clutter!</h3>

<p>Many things have been removed from the site. There&#8217;s nothing much in the sidebar. Its cleaned. The post pages are also clean. No big author bios and multiple social share buttons. You can find three popular share buttons at the bottom. That&#8217;s all!</p>

<h3>A more cleaner and a unique design&#8230;</h3>

<p>Unlike WordPress, the Octopress layout can be easily changed. I did a lot of customization to the default layout and then added my own theme. I tried to make something unique. For example, the way I added the category links in the header is a bit crazy. But I think it will work.</p>

<h3>Less categories&#8230;</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, adding more categories made the site look like a fruit salad. But now I have reduced it to 5. 5 main categories to group every thing. Now our goal is clear. Its not a fruit salad any more!</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>Since I use Octopress and generate a static HTML site, I can get free hosting on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>! Some people doesn&#8217;t go for free hosting because most of those hosting providers cannot be trusted and some even put ads on our sites. But Github is the world&#8217;s number one source code host! Millions of developers use it every day. So, there&#8217;s no question about their quality. Both the source code and the website can be hosted in Github.</p>

<h3>There are more&#8230;</h3>

<p>Apart from that, there are more changes to our site. For example, we will now reduce the amount of news posts we add. There are a lot of websites out there which does the job better than us. So, if there&#8217;s some big news topic, then I&#8217;ll write about it. Mostly, we will focus on tutorials and reviews.</p>

<p>Earlier, our markup didn&#8217;t pass W3 validations. Even-though I managed to make the site&#8217;s design W3 valid, after adding WordPress plugins, the validations failed. But now, the site is W3 valid!</p>

<p>Today we placed a big milestone for our blog. Many things have changed and will be changed in the future. I didn&#8217;t got time and interest to update the blog in the past few weeks. I&#8217;m turning into a developer. Octopress is extremely developer friendly. It use the tools we use every day like Git and Markdown. I like it! First I converted my other site <a href="http://youarecurio.us/">YouAreCurio.us</a> into Octopress and immediately felt its power.</p>

<p>I think Tech Hamlet will have a very bight future with these new changes. In a way, we have joined the open source developer community! Cool! So, what do you think about our new changes? Please let us know as comments below&#8230;</p>
