<p>If your <a href="http://www.techhamlet.com/tag/website/">website</a> is growing bigger, if you need a bigger home for your site, you might want to go for a bigger hosting plan. Everyone starts with normal shared hosting where you&rsquo;ll host your site in a server which have many other neighbors. After that, you go for a VPS which is semi shared. There might be several other sites in that server, but you get a virtually separate machine and a certain amount of dedicated resources. You have all the freedom to configure your whole server according to your needs just like a dedicated server&hellip;<!-- more --></p>

<p>Earlier this week, we moved <a href="http://www.techhamlet.com">Tech Hamlet</a> to a Virtual Private Server after testing for about two weeks. We tried many leading VPS providers. We refused some even before we move TH. We refused others after moving the site for about a day. We checked prices, server configurations, support from the host, and even the server performance. Actually, I learned a lot after dealing with these guys for two whole weeks, so I decided to write a good article on how to choose your VPS on last Monday : <a href="http://www.techhamlet.com/2011/03/choose-the-best-vps/">9 Tips to Choose the Best VPS Which Will go Perfectly With your Site</a></p>

<p>Today, im going to give small reviews on each and every VPS host that I used. This will definitely help you to select a good host for your site without getting into much trouble! So, shall we start?</p>

<h1>Linode :</h1>

<p>Linode have a very low price but very high performing servers. Thy will offer you 768 MB for just $29 with 4 processor Xen instances. Actually, when logged in, you&rsquo;ll recognize what I&rsquo;m saying about the performance. Their support is also really fast. You can get a reply within 1 hour. They also have data centers in 5 places including London. But, the problem is, you have to configure your server top to bottom. They&rsquo;ll offer you some useful guides, but still you need to be an expert to configure the server. I&rsquo;m saying this because, you need to configure the server well after installing the software. A badly configured system can lead into chaos! Another thing, if you are looking for control panels like Cpanel or Plesk to ease thing out, Linode is not the place for you. So, if you are an expert and know what you are doing, go for Linode!</p>

<blockquote><p>Support : Good</p>

<p>Server Performance : Perfect</p>

<p>Price : Perfect</p>

<p>Features : Good</p>

<p>Server Management : You are on your own</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.linode.com/"><img src="http://www.techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/linode.jpg" alt="Linode" /></a></p>

<h1>Rackspace :</h1>

<p>Rackspace have a very good name for their cloud based products. We already use their Cloud Files <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-boost-your-wordpress-blog-with-rackspace-cloud-files.html">as a CDN</a>. Rackspace also have a good support system with Live Chat and also have a reasonable price. But be careful, they charge for bandwidth! In here also you won&rsquo;t have Cpanel or Plesk panels. You have to configure everything by your selves. But, if you want them to manage your server and configure it for you, you can order a managed service level which will add a big amount to your bill (Nearly $186 per month). Nice isn&rsquo;t it? Now if you&rsquo;re a maniac who have a lot of money in your hands, go for Rackspace because it really have a good reputation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Support : Perfect</p></blockquote>

<p>Server Performance : Perfect</p>

<h1>1and1 :</h1>

<p>1and1 offers 512 MB dedicated memory and 2 GB burstable memory and free control panels for only $29! This is the reason which made made me try 1and1. Sign Up took several days because they wanted to verify my account. A bad start from the begging isn&rsquo;t it? After I got the server, I realized that its really slow and their control panel is really hard to understand. I spent a lot of times just to set up my domain. I think they have some bugs in their system. Their support is horrible. Sometimes, it will take more than 24 hours to get a reply. Their main site is well designed to attract your attention. But after you go inside, you&rsquo;ll understand the reality. Even I had troubles cancelling my account. They have mentioned that they will give us a refund if we leave withing 60 days. When I asked to cancel my account, they said that I have to stay for minimum of 30 days! I went mad and sent several emails. Finally managed to cancel my account and they promised to make the refund. But, still they haven&rsquo;t charged from me. As soon as they promised for the refund, they charged my PayPal account and took about a week to refund that money! Cool isn&rsquo;t it? If you are rich or poor, if your and expert or a newbie, everyone, stay away from 1and1 for good! Not a good hosting service!</p>

<blockquote><p>Support : Horrible</p></blockquote>

<p>Server Performance : Horrible</p>

<p>Price : Good</p>

<p>Features : Good</p>

<p>Server Management : You are on your own</p>

<p><a href="http://order.1and1.com/xml/order/VirtualServerL;jsessionid=562A7512EFB4FFEDAA859825D9374020.TCpfix142a?__frame=_top&amp;__lf=Static&amp;ordernow=true"><img src="http://www.techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1and1.jpg" alt="1and1" /></a></p>

<h1>VPS.net :</h1>

<p>VPS,net also have a good price. The best thing is, they have minute billing which will charge only for what you use! They also have a great easy to manage control panel which will ease things out while creating the VPS. But, for server control panels like Cpanel and Plesk, you have to pay extra. They also have a very good support team which will answer your queries withing an hour. But, for big tasks like installing third party <a href="http://www.techhamlet.com/category/software/">software</a>, they charge $10 per 24 hours. Still they have already configured web server images at your disposal. So, things will be a bit easier. Their servers are also very fast when you consider performance and also they offer free external monitoring. The only problem is that the server management is at our hands. So, think twice before going to VPS.net. They offer a really great service, but be careful about server management!</p>

<blockquote><p>Support : Good</p></blockquote>

<p>Server Performance : Perfect</p>

<h1>Hostgator :</h1>

<p><a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=earthorg">Hostgator</a> offers fully managed VPS systems with the Plesk panel for only $39. The price is very reasonable when you consider about the fully managed feature. They also give you private name servers to manage your DNS. But, they only have CentOS for the VPS server. Actually, Tech Hamlet was hosted in Hostgator&rsquo;s shared servers for a very long time and we know well about them. Their services are top class. With live chat support, they also have a very good ticket system which will answers your questions in a very short time. Their servers are also really fast and reliable. But, when I came to the VPS, I told them to transfer my site. It took them about 3 days for the transfer. As soon as I changed my DNS, the server&rsquo;s memory usage went sky high! The Apache is taking a huge amount of memory. So, I asked them to help me and they made several changes to my server but they didn&rsquo;t help. Finally I asked to install Nginx and they asked for about $75 for that! That&rsquo;s when I started to re think about my decision. Their service is good, servers are good&hellip; but this price tag for third party software installation didn&rsquo;t worked with me.</p>

<blockquote><p>Support : Perfect</p></blockquote>

<p>Server Performance : Perfect</p>

<p>Price : Good</p>

<p>Features : Good</p>

<p>Server Management : Fully Managed (Installing thirdparty software is not free)</p>

<p><a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=earthorg"><img src="http://www.techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/hostgator.jpg" alt="Hostgator" /></a></p>

<h1>Knownhost :</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.knownhost.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=639">Knownhost</a> have most of the features which Hostgator have to offer you plus, they offer free backups every other night and free third party software installations. Like Hostgator, these guys will also support only CentOS. They doesn&rsquo;t have live chat support, but their ticket system is really fast! You&rsquo;ll get a response in less than an hour. They&rsquo;ll charge an extra $5 for Cpanel or Plesk. Actually, they are really nice, they helped me to reconfigure my server with Nginx and Apache, and install several other third party software at no cost. Their servers are also fast and reliable. Our server was prepared withing few hours and after configuring it with their help, I was managed to bring TH for the final test. Memory usage went a bit higher so talked with them and made a minor adjustment which dramatically took it down. Now, Tech Hamlet is running on Knownhost for about 5 days and we are really happy with their service. I think they are the best VPS host which we have every tried. So, now we are settled with Knownhost for few more years.</p>

<blockquote><p>Support : Perfect</p></blockquote>

<p>Server Performance : Perfect</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I got to say about Virtual Private Servers. We settled with Knownhost, but according to your needs, you might choose a different host. So, read my other post (<a href="../2011/03/choose-the-best-vps/">9 Tips to Choose the Best VPS Which Will go Perfectly With your Site</a>) and pick your host wisely because your <a href="http://www.techhamlet.com/category/reviews/reviews-web/">web</a> site&rsquo;s future depends on your host! Now, after you choose your Hosting provider, don&rsquo;t forget to leave a comment and say which one you have picked!</p>
