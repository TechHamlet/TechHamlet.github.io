<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BlackBerryLondon.jpg"><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BlackBerryLondon-173x175.jpg" alt="BlackBerryLondon" /></a></p>

<p>It appears that BlackBerry isn&rsquo;t down for the count yet. It might be reeling after both Android and the iPhone dealt it serious blows, but a comeback is in the works. They&rsquo;ve been working on a new smartphone that uses the same operating system as the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, which is worlds better than the current BlackBerry OS 7. They&rsquo;re also planning to implement might higher-end hardware than any previous BlackBerry to date. Of course, those are both developments relative to previous BlackBerry models. What matters for the future BlackBerry is how these relate to other smartphone platforms.<!-- more --></p>

<p>In order for the new BlackBerry platform, BBX, to be successful it has to compare well to both Android and iPhone. That&rsquo;s a hefty task, considering how quickly both platforms passed the BlackBerry. It is now RIM&rsquo;s task to make up much of the ground that it lost. In order to accomplish that, the newest rumored BlackBerry, the BlackBerry London, needs to deliver in a serious way. It can&rsquo;t just be an ideal smartphone for November, 2011. Since rumor has it that it will launch late in the third quarter of 2012, it has to be the ideal smartphone for September, 2012.</p>

<p>The important question here: where will Android and iPhone be in September 2012? The answer will hold the key for BlackBerry.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone</strong></p>

<p>Of the two platforms, the iPhone is a bit more predictable. Apple has released a new iPhone every year since 2007, and while the iPhone 4S came later in the year than normally expected, that shouldn&rsquo;t throw off the once-a-year timeline. We can expect an iPhone 5 in 2012, and we can expect it to receive hype similar to previous iPhone releases. What we don&rsquo;t know, what we can&rsquo;t know, is exactly what Apple has planned for it.</p>

<p>Various rumors will reveal different information. One rumor had the iPhone 5 coming in with a larger screen. Further, it was rumored that it was supposed to drop this year instead of the 4S, but Steve Jobs killed it because it would ruin the uniformity of the iPhone line. That is, new screen dimensions would mean apps would work differently between devices. There are many plusses to this, especially since larger Android handsets sell very well. But will Apple adopt it?</p>

<p>There are other things we can definitely expect, such as a higher resolution screen, at least a dual-core processor and possibly faster, and, of course, Apple&rsquo;s one killer feature. They always do this with a new iPhone release. They&rsquo;ll have something up their sleeves with the iPhone 5. It&rsquo;s only a matter of how great an impact it will have. That makes it tough to determine where the iPhone will be in September, 2012, but it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that it will advance even beyond the considerable 4S.</p>

<p><strong>Android</strong></p>

<p>While the iPhone has been difficult to predict, Android has been something of the opposite. It hasn&rsquo;t been easy, per se, to predict where the platform is going. But we do know a few things about its progress by this point, and we can expect more of the same in 2012. That means continued progress on both hardware and software that will leave it in an envious position a year from now.</p>

<p>As it has done so many times, Android has raised the bar in the mobile game with its Nexus release. The original, the Nexus One, was more powerful than the iPhone 3GS. The next model, the Nexus S, had certain advantages over the iPhone 4. Now the Galaxy Nexus blows away the iPhone 4S from a technical standpoint. We can expect Android handsets to get even more powerful from here &mdash; there have even been rumors of a quad-core Android handset in 2012.</p>

<p>By September 2012 Android devices will be even more powerful. We&rsquo;ll be on the verge of another version release &mdash; Jelly Donut, maybe? &mdash; and another Nexus device. That will make the Android platform even more exciting. And that doesn&rsquo;t even mention all the developments that will occur before that in 2012. By September there will likely be a sea of Ice Cream Sandwich-running Android devices that range all the way from the highest end to the lowest. Consumers will have plenty of choice when it comes to Android.</p>

<p><strong>BlackBerry</strong></p>

<p>This brings us to the BlackBerry and where it will be in 2012. As of now we don&rsquo;t have word on much relating to the London&rsquo;s specs. We know, from RIM&rsquo;s co-CEO Mike Lazaridis, that BBX phones will require a dual-core processor. You can add that to the list. Recent history also gives us a decent idea of where RIM is headed in terms of hardware.</p>

<p>While the most recent line of BlackBerry 7 smartphones were met with little hype, each was the <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/smartphones/">best smartphone</a> RIM has yet released. They all feature fast processors and higher resolution screens, features that older models sorely lacked. Combined with more RAM, they make fast, efficient devices that can handle almost anything that other smartphone platforms can. The only issue is software, but that&rsquo;s a completely different story.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still difficult to see RIM surpassing iPhone and Android in the next year, since they&rsquo;re so far out in front. it&rsquo;s also difficult to see them offering up a phone with the same killer features and specs in September, 2012. Even with the much improved hardware in the BlackBerry 7 smartphones, they still don&rsquo;t quite touch the highest end iPhone and Android devices.</p>

<p>So where will the BlackBerry stand when the London releases? The best case scenario is just a tick behind Android and iPhone. That might sound bad, but it&rsquo;s actually a good position. With little chance of surpassing, all RIM has to do is even the race a bit more. That will win them some fans, and buy them time to get out ahead of the market. They did it once before &mdash; remember, RIM was once the market leader in smartphones, and for good reason. They can make the comeback again if things go right. Come September, 2012, all that matters is where they stand in relation to Android and iPhone.</p>
