    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For most of us, it&rsquo;s easy to think of software as a product. After all, you can purchase it in a shop and, for the most part, it works in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>The truth is, however, that we do not own the software we use. Anything you purchase is not yours. Instead you only own a licence; this is a common business model known as “Software as a Service” or SaaS for short.</p>

<p>To help understand this, here&rsquo;s a quick look at how this approach actually works and why, in cases where the software is rather important to you or your work, you may want to look into <a href="http://www.nccgroup.com/en/our-services/software-escrow-verification">software escrow</a> to further protect yourself.</p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/app_saas_img2.jpg" alt="Software as a Service" /> Software as a Service</p>

<h3>The License</h3>

<p>At its simplest, software is typically a licence, not a product. This is why you have to agree and enter into an end user agreement for most software products as this enters you into a SaaS agreement with the software provider.</p>

<p>The drawback to this is that you don&rsquo;t have access to the software&rsquo;s inner workings or source code. The advantage, however, is that it&rsquo;s not up to you to maintain the software. As your only leasing it, it’s up to the provider to offer a working product throughout this time. Should that fail to happen, disputes can happen and this is where escrow can become important.</p>

<h3>Verifying perspective</h3>

<p>In any dispute, it&rsquo;s easy to get drawn out into a longer disagreement. When you need software fast, such as when you rely or depend upon it for work, this isn&rsquo;t the best option. A lot of disagreements come around due to both sides being unable to agree on a solution. Instead, you should look to <a href="http://www.nccgroup.com/en/our-services/software-escrow-verification">escrow</a> to provide a neutral perspective from a legal stand point.</p>

<p>Escrow companies can verify software and make the right actions in accordance with the law. This should keep both sides happy but the simple act of putting the software in escrow ensures that the provider is serious about keeping their product in working order.</p>

<p>In many cases, it can be a simple sign of trust or added security. Developers design their software, as a product, to work, but having the added security layer of escrow support means both sides just want a working product. Should it come to it, the use of escrow will ensure, in cases where the agreement has been broken, you&rsquo;re given what you&rsquo;re legally entitled to.</p>

    <link href="http://techhamlet.com/2013/06/firefox-beats-chrome/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-20T19:34:26+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://techhamlet.com/2013/06/firefox-beats-chrome</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/browser-war-550x385.jpg" alt="Firefox vs Chrome" /> <em>Image Source : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50186930@N00/5948520195/">JUDEE</a></em></p>

<p>Yesterday I had a good chuckle at my friends words &lsquo;Chrome never ceases to amaze me&rsquo; Personally, I find lots of problems with Google&rsquo;s so called wonder browser Chrome and although I do use it sometimes to try new add-ons that sound interesting, I prefer to stick with Firefox.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what annoys me most about Chrome: firstly, it uses tons of memory; a lot more, in fact, than Firefox, which people accuse of being slower. Just bring up your Task Manager when you&rsquo;re running Chrome to see how many different processes it has open &ndash; one for each tab &ndash; and how much memory it&rsquo;s using. I guarantee you&rsquo;ll be surprised.</p>

<p>Secondly, its always crashing and showing that stupid &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead Jim&rsquo; message as if the inconvenience were supposed to be funny. And you can bet that when your PC hangs on shutdown because a program needs to be closed the culprit is Chrome. LOL.</p>

<p>I also dislike the often scary list of permissions, you need to agree to when installing certain extensions, giving them access to your data on all websites, as well as your tabs, bookmarks and browsing activity. Given Google&rsquo;s notoriety for storing personal info, these permissions make me paranoid, no matter how harmless they may be. Firefox add-ons don&rsquo;t make these demands so why would Chrome get away with it?</p>

<h3>Firefox vs Chrome, who is the winner?</h3>

<p>If you ask me, Chrome is very overrated, especially compared to more innovative browsers such as Opera, Maxthon and yes Firefox. I also prefer Mozilla&rsquo;s non-profit ethos to Google&rsquo;s sneaky tax-avoiding tricks, and find bookmarks much easier to manage in Firefox. My friend is entitled to his views, bit look closer at Chrome and you&rsquo;ll see the cracks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/octopress-550x385.jpg" alt="Octopress" /> Octopress</p>

<p>I always felt Wordpress is too much for me. I wanted something simple, something more customizable and something really fast! So, why not go with Octopress? It&rsquo;s a blogging platform that runs on your own machine. It generate static HTML files and upload them to the server. No dynamic content. That means the website is extremely fast! You have a local copy and Git is already used by the framework which you can use to send backups to remote servers like Github and Bitbucket. Its fast, reliable and extremely customizable!</p>

<p>Octopress is a platform built on Jekyll which use Ruby to generate static HTML blogs. You write your posts in Markdown and place them in a separate folder. When generating the website, Octopress will use these markdown files and the layouts you defined to generate your website. Its a bit geeky but you can learn it. Octopress have a very good documentation which will guide you through all the steps. After generating, you just have to push it to the web server. If you need to move to a new server, you don&rsquo;t have to run complex scripts and setup databases. Just push to the new address and the website will work.</p>

<p>You might think that we need dynamic stuff for comments. Actually, I already use Disqus. Octopress have built in Disqus integration which can be used for comments. I just moved my site without loosing any of the existing comments!</p>

<p>For hosting, you can use any simple web server. Any server can serve simple static HTML files. You also don&rsquo;t need a big server because there are no server-side scripting used in Octopress. You can even host the site in GitHub for free! I used that option. The website&rsquo;s code is now open sourced!</p>

<h3>Read more about Octopress &hellip;</h3>

<p>What do you think? Octopress have all the thing I need. No extra stuff to slow down the site. You can read more about Octopress and even enjoy my new site if you go there now : <a href="http://youarecurio.us/2013/06/wordpress-to-octopress/">Moved From Wordpress to Octopress!

    <id>http://techhamlet.com/2013/05/popularity-of-online-shopping-increased-through-social-media</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, more and more people are discovering the massive benefits of shopping online instead of the traditional way of going to a retail store in the neighborhood. In fact, it is possible to purchase almost any item online by simply looking for shops that offer the kind of products you have in mind.</p>

<p>Even at the comfort of your own home, you can shop for gadgets, clothes, food, and home appliances. If you want to save more money on an iPad, for instance, you can search for promos available online such as <a href="http://www.myvouchercodes.co.uk/pixmania">free delivery on iPads with this voucher</a>. You will be amazed to discover a huge number of online stores that offer discounts and vouchers to customers.</p>

<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/online-shop-550x366.jpg" alt="Online Shopping" /> <em>Image Source : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reway2007/5268693079/">reway2007</a></em></p>

<h3>What the Stats Say</h3>

<p>Based on studies, younger consumers are more accustomed to shopping online, particularly those who are fond of using social media in searching for the right item to purchase. In fact, online shopping is already second nature to them, despite the less amount of quality time they get to spend with their shopping buddies at the mall.</p>

<p>While internet shopping is a popular option in several nations, researchers have discovered that most <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20700046">people from the UK are frequent online shoppers</a>, as compared to any other countries in the world.</p>

<p>In a study by the Ofcom, UK consumers spend about £1,083 annually on items bought online, which place them at the top of the list. Moreover, these consumers are fond of shopping for mobile devices since they get to avail of discounts and special promos online.</p>

<p>Aside from online shopping, UK adults are engaged in social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook, and they use their mobile devices to access these sites.</p>

<p>This trend is even more evident in adults between 18 and 24 years old, as 62 percent of individuals in this age group are into mobile devices, online shopping and social media.</p>

<h3>Why Shop Online</h3>

<p>Primarily, people who prefer to buy items online are exploring the benefits of social shopping. Although they may lack face-to-face interactions with their friends each time they shop, they are still able to communicate with other shoppers by visiting social sites.</p>

<p>For instance, there are brand sites that enable them to create a community or participate in forums and talk about their opinions of a product bought online. They may also spread the word about a recent promo they have seen in sites such as a <a href="http://www.myvouchercodes.co.uk/istockphoto">15% off all credit packs at iStockPhoto</a> or massive discounts for electronics and devices.</p>

<p>These sites serve as a place to bring all shoppers together and narrate their online shopping-related experiences, which can guide other consumers, as well.</p>

<p>You can also come across social media websites that revolve around product ratings, reviews, suggestions and opinions. It is also quite easy to make your own shopping lists online, join groups and ask for product suggestions from your contacts. Then, you can boost your savings by checking out location-based sites for the latest promos or discounts available.</p>

<p>Online shopping has reinvented the way people buy things, and social media has made the entire process of internet buying even more fun and more convenient than ever. It is now hassle-free to check reviews and forums about a product to maximize your chances of finding the perfect item online that is worth your time and money.</p>

    <link href="http://techhamlet.com/2013/05/what-can-you-do-in-the-cloud/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-30T07:59:34+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://techhamlet.com/2013/05/what-can-you-do-in-the-cloud</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://techhamlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cloud-Storage-550x440.jpg" alt="Cloud" /></p>

<p>The Cloud has come to revolutionise the way we not only interact with large amounts of data, but the way we store it as well. In recent years it has become a mainstay institution of many business sectors such as finance, accounting and human resources. But what can you actually do with it? Well, in short, a lot! <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/centurylink/2013/04/16/managing-your-data-growth-by-migrating-to-cloud-storage/">Migrating a business’s data onto the Cloud</a> is just the first step. Here are a few extremely important things which using the Cloud can allow a business to do.</p>

<h3>Secure data storage</h3>

<p>Of course, the most important and well-documented feature of the Cloud is its ability to store data online. What was once the chore of large location-based servers and hard drives carrying a company’s vital information such as client and customer details from a system like Sage One (which are commonly used in the accounting industry) is now stored online.</p>

<p>The huge virtual hard drives of the Cloud now allow this data to be stored online, meaning that it’s often a lot more secure than on a physical server which runs the risk of breaking down or crashing and losing a business’s valuable data forever.</p>

<h3>Free up office space</h3>

<p>Online data storage also has an extremely healthy benefit for office and technology business meaning the actual physical space taken up by physical hard drives and servers can be reduced, and more space created. There is also the fact that no depending on physical hardware may in the long run save a business a lot more money as they will not have to constantly invest in new machinery to accommodate ever-burgeoning amounts of data.</p>

<h3>Remote access</h3>

<p>The Cloud’s other chief point of interest is remote access. This means that when viewing, uploading or downloading any of a company’s data, you do not have to be in the exact location of the server. You can view this data from anywhere in the world – at home or on the move.</p>

<p>This is particularly useful in businesses which update their data frequently, such as accounting. <a href="http://uk.sageone.com/blog/2013/01/31/cloud-control/">Cloud accounting</a> can allow a business to access, upload or alter any amount of valuable data wherever they are, at whatever time of the day they need to, and not have to wait until Monday morning.</p>

<h3>Extra security</h3>

<p>The security systems that are utilised by the cloud are much safer than the standard virus, malware and Trojan horse based anti-virus systems of most standard computers and databases. Storing valuable data online may seem like a bit of an oxymoron but it is generally much safer than on a smaller computer system, with a team’s software technicians constantly working to identify new threats.</p>
